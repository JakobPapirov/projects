# projects
This repo holds the meta project "projects". The project hasn't been updated in quite a long time and is badly in need of an update to ease of maintenance and to be more functional and visually pleasing. No development has been done mainly due to lack of interest while working on new projects but also with a lack of ideas.

I plan to write a new version that should solve all issues listed above. This new version will feature a login behind which I can update and add a new project. This will all be viewable from outside the login. Hopefully I'm able to implement an automated checker to keep track of if any site is down.
The project manager will show information about purpose of the project, tech used, version, github link, current state of the project (dormant, finished, abandoned).
